<h4>Distributor</h4>
<p>
 The Distributor is a sub-type of the Sloodle module, and it works with the Sloodle Distributor tool in-world.
 A single Distributor module in Moodle stores the list of inventory of a Sloodle Distributor in Second Life, and controls access to it.
 You can add as many as you like to your course, but there should only be one Distributor object in-world for <i>each</i> Distributor
  module in your Moodle course.
